        'Overview\r\n\r\nThe 18th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation seeks to present innovative, exciting research in computer systems. OSDI brings together professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds in a premier forum for discussing the design, implementation, and implications of systems software. OSDI emphasizes innovative research and quantified or insightful experiences in systems design and implementation.\r\n\r\nOSDI takes a broad view of the systems area and solicits contributions from many fields of systems practice, including operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data, embedded systems, virtualization, networking as it relates to operating systems, and management and troubleshooting of complex systems. We also welcome work that explores the interface to related areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, analytics, and databases. We encourage contributions with highly original ideas, new approaches, and groundbreaking results.\r\n\r\nSubmitting a Paper\r\n\r\nSubmissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. Accepted papers will be shepherded through an editorial review process by a member of the program committee.\r\n\r\nA good paper will:\r\n\r\n    Motivate a significant problem\r\n    Propose an interesting and compelling solution\r\n    Demonstrate the practicality and benefits of the solution\r\n    Draw appropriate conclusions\r\n    Clearly describe the paper\' s contributions\r\n Clearly articulate the advances beyond previous work\r\n\r\nAccepted papers will generally be available online TO registered attendees BEFORE the conference. IF your accepted paper should NOT be published PRIOR TO the event,
        please notify production@usenix.org. The papers will be available online TO everyone beginning ON
        the FIRST DAY OF the symposium.\r\n\r\nPapers accompanied BY nondisclosure agreement forms will NOT be considered. ALL submissions will be treated AS confidential PRIOR TO publication ON
        the OSDI \'24 website; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.\r\n\r\nSimultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud. USENIX, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may, on the recommendation of a program chair, take action against authors who have committed them. See the USENIX Conference Submissions Policy for details.\r\n\r\nSubmitting a paper that had been previously submitted to and not accepted by another conference is permitted as long as the authors have substantially addressed the previous reviewers\' comments. IF the PRIOR conference\'s rejection notification has been received less than two months before the OSDI \' 24 submission deadline,
        THEN the authors ARE requested TO provide information regarding the previous submission
        AND a summary OF the subsequent revisions TO the paper. This information should be uploaded via the submission form,
        AND will NOT be shared WITH the OSDI \'24 reviewers.\r\n\r\nPrior or concurrent workshop publication does not preclude publishing a related paper in OSDI. The online submission form will require authors to submit a copy of the related workshop paper and a short explanation of the new material in the conference paper beyond that published in the workshop version. The co-chairs may then share that paper with the workshop\' s organizers
        AND discuss it WITH them.\r\n\r\nPrior
        OR concurrent publication IN non - peer - reviewed contexts,
        LIKE arXiv.org,
        technical reports,
        talks,
        AND social media posts,
        IS permitted. However,
        your OSDI submission must use an anonymized name FOR your project
        OR SYSTEM that differs
    FROM
        ANY used IN such contexts.\r\n\r\nUSENIX discourages program co - chairs
    FROM
        submitting papers TO the conferences they organize,
        although they ARE allowed TO do so. Should either program co - chair submit WORK TO OSDI \'24, their papers will be handled exclusively by the other program co-chair and reviewed according to the same rigorous and double-blinded procedures that the program committee applies to all papers. In the event that a paper is co-authored by, or otherwise conflicted with both co-chairs, the co-chairs will designate a PC member to manage the reviewing process for that paper.\r\n\r\nQuestions? Contact your program co-chairs, osdi24chairs@usenix.org, or the USENIX office, submissionspolicy@usenix.org.\r\n\r\nBy submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. If the conference registration fee will pose a hardship for the presenter of the accepted paper, please contact conference@usenix.org. For very special circumstances (such as travel restrictions or health issues), USENIX may provide the possibility of remote presentation and Q&A.\r\n\r\nIf your paper is accepted and you need an invitation letter to apply for a visa to attend the conference, please contact conference@usenix.org as soon as possible. Visa applications are reportedly taking more than two months to process. Please identify yourself as a presenter or an author, and include your mailing address in your email request.'

        'The CAiSE’24 organization calls for full papers with a special emphasis on the theme of Information Systems in the Age of Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative technology, revolutionizing various industries, and its significance in Information Systems cannot be overstated. AI-powered systems have the potential to streamline operations, enhance decision-making processes, and drive innovation across organizations. From data analysis to automated processes, AI is reshaping the way we leverage information in the digital age. The relevance of AI in IS extends beyond internal operations. AI-powered predictive analytics enables organizations to forecast trends, anticipate customer needs, and optimize resource allocation. This empowers businesses to adapt swiftly to changing market dynamics, gain a competitive edge, and make proactive decisions. AI algorithms can also detect anomalies and patterns that indicate potential security breaches, contributing to robust cybersecurity measures in information systems. However, while acknowledging the benefits, it is essential to consider the ethical implications of AI in information systems. Ensuring data privacy, addressing bias in algorithms, and maintaining transparency are vital aspects that need to be carefully managed and regulated to foster trust and accountability.\r\n\r\nIn addition to offering an exciting scientific program, CAiSE’24 will feature a best paper award, a journal special issue, and a PhD-thesis award: \r\n\r\n    Best Paper Award‚ prize EUR 1000 (sponsored by Springer)\r\n    A small selection of best papers will be invited to submit enhanced versions for consideration in a special issue of Elsevier Information Systems journal dedicated to this conference.\r\n    PhD-Thesis Award\r\n    Best PhD thesis of a past CAISE Doctoral Consortium author (co-sponsored by the CAiSE Steering Committee and Springer)\r\n\r\nPapers should be submitted in PDF format. Submissions must conform to Springer‚ LNCS format and should not exceed 15 pages, including all text, figures, references, and appendices. Submissions not conforming to the LNCS format, exceeding 15 pages, or being obviously out of the scope of the conference, will be rejected without review. See the guidelines here: https://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/authors.html\r\n\r\nThe results described must be unpublished and must not be under review elsewhere. Three to five keywords characterizing the paper should be listed at the end of the abstract. Each paper will be reviewed by at least two program committee members and, if positively evaluated, by one additional program board member. The selected papers will be discussed among the paper reviewers online and during the program board meeting. As the review process is not blind, please indicate your name and affiliation on your submission. Accepted papers will be presented at CAiSE’24 and published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) conference proceedings. \r\n\r\nWe invite three types of original and scientific papers. The type of submission must be indicated in the submission system. Each contribution should explicitly address the engineering or the operation of information systems, clearly identify the information systems problem addressed, the expected impact of the contribution to information system engineering or operation, and the research method used. We strongly advise authors to clearly emphasize these aspects in their paper, including the abstract. \r\n\r\nTechnical papers describe original solutions (theoretical, methodological or conceptual) in the field of IS Engineering. A technical paper should clearly describe the situation or problem tackled, the relevant state of the art, the position or solution suggested and its potential‚ as well as demonstrate the benefits of the contribution through a rigorous evaluation.\r\n\r\nEmpirical papers evaluate existing problem situations including problems encountered in practice, or validate proposed solutions with scientific means, i.e., by empirical studies, experiments, case studies, experience reports, simulations, etc. Scientific reflection on problems and practices in industry also falls into this category. The topic of the evaluation presented in the paper as well as its causal or logical properties must be clearly stated. The research method must be sound and appropriate.\r\n\r\nExploratory papers describe completely new research positions or approaches, in order to face a generic situation arising because of new ICT tools, new kinds of activities, or new IS challenges. They must precisely describe the situation and demonstrate why current methods, tools, ways of reasoning, or meta-models are inadequate. They must also rigorously present their approach and demonstrate its pertinence and correctness in addressing the identified situation.'

        'The IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA) is the premier gathering of practitioners and researchers interested in software architecture, component-based software engineering, and quality aspects of complex software systems. The 21st IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA 2024) continues the tradition of a working conference, where practitioners and researchers meet and where software architects can explain the challenges they face and try to influence the future of the field. Interactive working sessions will be the place where researchers meet practitioners to identify opportunities to create the future.\r\n\r\nRecent advances in capabilities and availability of generative artificial intelligence (AI) now allow users to generate text, source code, graphics, videos, and 3D models based on natural language descriptions. Software architects are already starting to use these tools to rationalize design decisions, to explore technology options, to synthesize source code based on patterns, and to generate architecture diagrams. The theme of ICSA 2024 is thus “Software Architecture in the Age of Generative AI”. The conference welcomes contributions exploring the potentials and risks of this new technology for software architecture. We are particularly interested in soliciting papers describing novel tools, techniques, and methods to support software architects using generative AI. We are also looking for software and system architecture case studies that successfully or unsuccessfully applied this new technology.\r\n\r\nBesides the main theme, we call on both researchers and practitioners for contributions that advance our understanding of architectures in real-world software, facilitate empirical research by making architectural artifacts and tools publicly available, and promote replicability of results through common datasets and benchmarks. We welcome original papers that explore and explain the role of architecture in current systems and future systems. This conference looks at what can be learned from our software architecture history, experience, studies, and best practices.\r\n\r\nTopics\r\n\r\nTopics of interest for the conference include (but are not limited to) the following:\r\n\r\n    Requirements & Architecture\r\n        Stakeholder management and collaborating with other domains\r\n        Stakeholder management and collaborating with other domains\r\n        Linking architecture to requirements and/or implementation\r\n        Methods to address the intertwining of specification and design\r\n        Sustainability, ethics, business, financial, and managerial aspects of software architecture\r\n    Architecture Design\r\n        Model-driven architecture\r\n        Component-based software engineering\r\n        Architecture frameworks and architecture description languages\r\n        Reusable architectural solutions & architecture knowledge management\r\n    Cloud-native Computing & Architecture\r\n        Microservices & containerization\r\n        Serverless platforms & novel forms of virtualization (WASM, MicroVMs, etc.)\r\n        Event-driven architectures\r\n        Observability & Distributed Tracing\r\n    Architecture Evaluation\r\n        Evaluating quality aspects (e.g., security, performance, reliability, evolvability)\r\n        AI/ML techniques for architecture\r\n        Architecture conformance checking\r\n        Lightweight evaluation methods\r\n    Architecture & Life-cycle\r\n        Automatic extraction and generation of software architecture descriptions\r\n        Architecture & continuous integration/delivery, and DevOps\r\n        Refactoring and evolving architecture design decisions and solutions\r\n        Agile architecting, continuous architecting, and other approaches to architecting\r\n    Architecture & Architects\r\n        Roles and responsibilities for software architects\r\n        Training, soft skills, coaching, mentoring, education, and certification\r\n        Architecture for equality, diversity and inclusion\r\n        State-of-the-art and state-of-practice in software architecture\r\n    Architecture for specific types of systems, such as:\r\n        Edge / Fog / Internet of Things (IoT) systems / IoB systems\r\n        AI / ML systems & systems using blockchains\r\n        Cyber-physical systems\r\n        Self-adaptive & autonomous systems\r\n    Architecture & Generative AI:\r\n        Design assistance & identification of architectural patterns\r\n        Decision making support, comparing technologies, evaluating trade-offs\r\n        Generating source code to facilitate implementing architecture designs\r\n        Reviewing designs, identifying inconsistencies, and suggesting improvements'

        'Special Issue on Verification, Control, and Repair in Business Process Management\r\n截稿日期: 2024-05-31\r\n\r\nBusiness process management supports the coordination of complex and interrelated activities within one or many organizations. The legitimate executions of business processes (BPs) are usually represented through a BP model, specifying a partial order between the activities to regulate their execution order (control-flow perspective). Several BP models are also augmented with:\r\n\r\ntime and temporal constraints (time perspective)\r\nresources and allocation policies for task executions (resource perspective)\r\ndata and value assignments to keep track of more sources of information (data perspective)\r\n\r\nIf a BP model contains errors in any of the perspectives above, the execution of the BP may end with some constraint violated or remain blocked in a livelock/deadlock where progress/conclusion is no longer possible. Errors in BP models reveal imprecision in BPs (illegitimate behavior, over-constrained models, etc.). All this can only worsen if some parts of the BP are uncontrollable (task duration, choice of execution branch, resource availability, variable value assignments, etc.). To guarantee that BPs can be executed \"safely\" three main methods can be employed:\r\n\r\nverification: determination of errors, constraint violations, livelocks/deadlocks\r\ncontrol: restriction of the possible executions to ensure constraint satisfaction/process completion\r\nrepair: modification of the model to prevent constraint violations/deadlocks/livelocks\r\n\r\nThis special issue looks for submissions delving into these three areas of BPs with particular focus on temporal, resource, and data perspectives, considered in isolation or simultaneously, with respect to discrete and/or continuous domains, employing techniques applied at design or runtime. All techniques advancing these areas are welcome. Techniques coming from or lying at the intersection of communities beyond the BPM/IS/PM, whose results can be tailored to BPs, are especially welcome. Pertinent review papers are also welcome.\r\n\r\nGuest editors:\r\nAssist.
